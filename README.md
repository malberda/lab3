Description

A simple Hash Table System using an array as a base. included is a function to find the smallest set of twin primes within a given range. in addition, i replicated the remove, contains, clear, size methods described in HashMap interface in java's api.

Getting Started

To execute:

run javac *.java

1- integer based on nextInt()
2- Long based on System.currentTimeMillis()
3- a String from the word-list file.


load Factor is stored in a, used in 
n(number of elements read)=a*m where m is the prime.


Debug level  is 0-1 or nothing, which results in a debug level of 0. where
0- prints summary of expirement to the console
1- prints summary of experiment to the console, and prints the hash tables to two files, linear-dump and double-dump.
